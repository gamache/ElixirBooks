###[Elixir School](http://elixirschool.com/) *Free*

<img src="http://elixir-lang.org/images/learning/elixir-school.jpg" width="120px"/>

Elixir-School is an open and community driven effort inspired by Twitter’s Scala School. The site’s content consists of peer-reviewed lessons on various Elixir topics that range in difficulty. The lessons are currently available in over 10 languages to help make programming Elixir more accessible to non-English speakers.

###[Introducing Elixir](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do)

Elixir is an excellent language if you want to learn about functional programming, and with this hands-on introduction, you’ll discover just how powerful and fun Elixir can be. This language combines the robust functional programming of Erlang with a syntax similar to Ruby, and includes powerful features for metaprogramming.

###[Études for Elixir](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642) *Free*

In this book, you will find descriptions of programs that you can write in Elixir. The programs will usually be short, and each one has been designed to provide practice material for a particular Elixir programming concept. These programs have not been designed to be of considerable difficulty, though they may ask you to stretch a bit beyond the immediate material and examples that you find in the book Introducing Elixir.

###[Elixir Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/elixir-cookbook)

This book is a set of recipes grouped by topic that acts as a good reference to get ideas from or to quickly search for a solution to a problem. You will begin by launching an IEx session and using it to test some ideas. Next, you will perform various operations like loading and compiling modules, inspecting your system, generating a supervised app, and so on. Furthermore, you will be introduced to immutability, working with data structures, performing pattern matching, and using stream modules to generate infinite data sequences. You will learn about everything from joining strings to determining the word frequency in text. With respect to modules and functions, you will also discover how to load code from other modules and use guards and pattern matching in functions.

###[Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action)

Elixir in Action teaches you to apply the new Elixir programming language to practical problems associated with scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability.

###[The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook)

<img src="https://images.manning.com/255/340/resize/book/b/652215c-a8c9-42a1-b04f-264846c99cc5/ElixirOTP_hires_meap.png" width="120px"/>

The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook gets you started programming applications with Elixir and OTP. You begin with a quick overview of the Elixir language syntax, along with just enough functional programming to use it effectively. Then, you'll dive straight into OTP and learn how it helps you build scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed applications through several fun examples. Come rediscover the joy of programming with Elixir and remember how it feels like to be a beginner again.

###[Learning Elixir](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-elixir)

<img src="https://d255esdrn735hr.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/B04907_MockupCover_Normal.jpg" width="120px"/>

Elixir, based on Erlang’s virtual machine and ecosystem, makes it easier to achieve scalability, concurrency, fault tolerance, and high availability goals that are pursued by developers using any programming language or programming paradigm. Elixir is a modern programming language that utilizes the benefits offered by Erlang VM without really incorporating the complex syntaxes of Erlang.

###[Metaprogramming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir)

<img src="http://elixir-lang.org/images/learning/metaprogramming-elixir.jpg" width="120px"/>

Write code that writes code with Elixir macros. Macros make metaprogramming possible and define the language itself. In this book, you’ll learn how to use macros to extend the language with fast, maintainable code and share functionality in ways you never thought possible. You’ll discover how to extend Elixir with your own first-class features, optimize performance, and create domain-specific languages.

###[Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do)

<img src="http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920024149/lrg.jpg" width="120px"/>

If you need to build a scalable, fault tolerant system with requirements for high availability, discover why the Erlang/OTP platform stands out for the breadth, depth, and consistency of its features. This hands-on guide demonstrates how to use the Erlang programming language and its OTP framework of reusable libraries, tools, and design principles to develop complex commercial-grade systems that simply cannot fail.
